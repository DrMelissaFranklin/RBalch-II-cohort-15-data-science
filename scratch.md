worked on reviewing mysql and learning sql lite syntax
worked on reviewing my notes and preparing to do additional regression methods (lasso) on project 2
worked on changingmy notes to be more convienently updated and added scripts to convert files using jq JSON processing tool

Blocked by needing to understand RFE and RFECV and when to use it
blocked by time constraints to add more to my project 2

looking forward to more sql review and practice
looking forward to setting up new notes in notebooklm with all of my sources in the same format and missing nothing.
